JavaScript provides seven different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object.

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. 
They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. 
Any of the seven data types may be stored in a variable.

All variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

function convertToF(celsius) {
  var fahrenheit;
  // Only change code below this line
  fahrenheit =  celsius * 9/5 + 32;  
  
  // Only change code above this line
  return fahrenheit;
}

// Change the inputs below to test your code
convertToF(30);


Here is a table of common escape sequences:

Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	backspace
\f	form feed

.length
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";

// Only change code below this line.

lastNameLength = lastName.length;


Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.
