JavaScript provides seven different data types which are undefined, null, boolean, string, symbol, number, and object.

Variables allow computers to store and manipulate data in a dynamic fashion. 
They do this by using a "label" to point to the data rather than using the data itself. 
Any of the seven data types may be stored in a variable.

All variables and function names are case sensitive. This means that capitalization matters.

function convertToF(celsius) {
  var fahrenheit;
  // Only change code below this line
  fahrenheit =  celsius * 9/5 + 32;  
  
  // Only change code above this line
  return fahrenheit;
}

// Change the inputs below to test your code
convertToF(30);


Here is a table of common escape sequences:

Code	Output
\'	single quote
\"	double quote
\\	backslash
\n	newline
\r	carriage return
\t	tab
\b	backspace
\f	form feed

.length
var lastNameLength = 0;
var lastName = "Lovelace";
lastNameLength = lastName.length;


Bracket notation is a way to get a character at a specific index within a string.
Use Bracket Notation to Find the NthtoLast Character in a String
  var secondToLastLetterOfLastName = lastName[lastName.length - 2];
  
 
Word Blanks game
You will create an (optionally humorous) "Fill in the Blanks" style sentence.
  function wordBlanks(myNoun, myAdjective, myVerb, myAdverb) {
    var result = "";
    var space = " ";
    result = "My " + myAdjective + space + myNoun + space + myVerb + space + myAdverb + " on the fence.";
    return result;
  }
  wordBlanks("dog", "big", "ran", "quickly");
  
Store Multiple Values in one Variable using JavaScript Arrays
  var ourArray = ["John", 23];

Nest one Array within Another Array - Multi-dimensional array
  var myArray = [["Guitar", 1], ["Dog", 2]];

Modify Array Data With Indexes
  var myArray = [1,2,3];
  myArray[0] = 3; //[3,2,3]

multi-dimensional array, is as an array of arrays
  var myArray = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9], [[10,11,12], 13, 14]];
  var myData = myArray[2][1];
